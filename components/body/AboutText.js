           <div className='text-4xl my-4'>Wayne Bowen is an artist who, since the eighties, has studied to capture life in the form of realism. </div>
          <div className='text-2xl my-4'>Much of his work contrasts the stylistic and conceptual art forms of the eighties. His form of realism exemplifies itself in oils, watercolors, pen and ink, and pastels. While the artist appears to employ a basic academic approach, upon closer observation the colors and detail captivate and tell a story of their own. His colors are seductively light and soft, demanding attention and opinion. His meticulous approach to detail cannot be overlooked. It creates the backdrop for his life-like expressions.</div>
          <div className='text-2xl my-4'>Mr. Bowen's work is backed by organizations such as The National Foundation for the Advancement in the Arts and the School of Visual Arts Alumni Society. Many investors consider his work uniquely collectible.</div>
